# Education and Research

## General

- [Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/eightthings.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
```markdown 
 1. LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without targeted innovation.
 2. Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of increasing investment.
 3. LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world.
 4. There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs.
 5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs.
 6. Human performance on a task isn’t an upper bound on LLM performance.
 7. LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded in web text.
 8. Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.
```

- Observations:
  1. LLM Output can be ambiguous 
  2. LLM output can be inconsistent because of stochasticity --> Prompt engineering is possible.

- [A Survey of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.18223.pdf) A very comprehensive paper discussing LLM technology. 

### Self-supervised learning
- ‼️ [A cookbook of self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12210.pdf) 


## Tokenization
- [Tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) uses BPE and is theoretically used in GPT models. 
- [Token Monster](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster) Uses 35% fewer tokens and uses a top-down approach, instead of a bottom-up constructive approach. Likely of high value. 


## Embeddings
‼️[What are Embeddings](http://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/)[Github](https://github.com/veekaybee/what_are_embeddings/blob/main/README.md)




## Metrics:
- Exact Match (EM) 

## Transformers

- [Formal Algorithms for Transformers in 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09238.pdf)
Important discussion revealing the components of Transformers.

!!! note

  **Tasks:**

  * Chunking: breaking up into smaller chunks
  * Sequence modeling (DTransformer: NExt prediction 
  * Sequence modeling (EDTransformer): Seq2Seq mappingto different domains.
  * Classification (Etransformer): classification

  **Tokenization:** 
  Starts with a vocabulary but then must be encoded in some way. 

  * Character Level: Has very long sequences
  * Word Level: Rare words don't work
  * Subword level: Simpleset and most successful is Byte Pair Encoding
  * Special Characters: `mask_token`, `bos_token` (beginning of sequence), `eos_token`
  
 
  **Components:**
  
  * Token Embedding: Mapping to a vector space. 
  * Positional Embedding: Learned or hard-coded mapping to position of sequence to a vector space
  * Attention: Token being predicted is mapped to a query vector and tokens in context are mapped to key and value vectors. Inner products are used to combine to extract information. 
  * Bi-directional / unmasked
  * Unidirectional / masked self attetion
  * Cross attention applies attention to the primary sequence and treates the second token sequence the context. 
  * Multi-head attention. Multiple attention heads in parallel.
  * Layer normalization. Found to be computationally efficient version sets m = beta = 0 or root mean square layer normalizagion or `RMSnorm`. 
  * Unembedding: Learns to convert vector intot he vocuabulary elements. 
  
  **Architectures:**

  * Encoder-Decoder (EDT), is also sequence-to-sequence. 
  * Encoder-only: (BERT)
  * Decoder-only (GPT) Next-token 
  * Multi-domain decoder-only transformer (Gato)

  **Practical considerations**

  * Data preprocessing: Cleaning, augmenting, noising, shuffling, t
  * Architectures: sparce layers, weight-sharing
  * Training: minibatch, batch norm, weight initialization, ensembling, adversarial
  * Regularization: weight decay early stopping cross-validation, dropout, noise


### LLM Model Variations
To improve length:
- [Scaling Transformer to 1M tokens and beyond with RMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062) [Github](https://github.com/booydar/t5-experiments/tree/scaling-report) Uses a Recurrent Memory Transformer(RMT) architecture to extend understanding to large lengths. 
- ‼️[MEGABYTE: Predicting Million-byte Sequences with Multiscale Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07185.pdf) MEGABYTE segments sequences into patches and uses a local submodel within patches and a global model between patches
- [Hyena Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10866.pdf) Uses inspiration from FFT to create a drop in replacement for Transformer models. Quite complex and maybe overhyped.
  
## Improvements and Optimizations
### Fine Tuning
Using exmaples to fine tune a model can reduce the number of tokens needed to achieve an sufficiently reasonable response. Can be expensive to retrain though.
- [Self fine tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11610.pdf) Using Chain of thought to provide better examples and then fine tune the LLM. 
- [Refiner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01904.pdf) Iteratively improves itself based on an LLM critic
<img width="713" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ianderrington/general/assets/76016868/3ac44e13-2444-4f1e-ae3b-800c9d32ce59">

### Fine Tuning using Distillation
Train on model trains a new model on the output of a new model. 
- [Alpaca ](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)

### Adapter layers
- [AdapterHub: A Framework for Adapting Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07779.pdf) [Website](https://adapterhub.ml/)
Adapters are efficient and performant layers that can optimize performance without needing to do inefficient fine-tuning.

- ‼️ [RLHF basics by hugging face](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) A realy good intro to parse again.
- [RLHF for Palm in Pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch)


## Prompt and optimization

### Manual Prompt optimization

### Auto Prompt Optimizations
[A good description of advanced prompt tuning](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/advanced-prompt-engineering)
```
AutoPrompt [5] combines the original prompt input with a set of shared (across all input data) “trigger tokens” that are selected via a gradient-based search to improve performance.

Prefix Tuning [6] adds several “prefix” tokens to the prompt embedding in both input and hidden layers, then trains the parameters of this prefix (leaving model parameters fixed) with gradient descent as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy.

Prompt Tuning [7] is similar to prefix tuning, but prefix tokens are only added to the input layer. These tokens are fine-tuned on each task that the language model solves, allowing prefix tokens to condition the model for a given task.

P-Tuning [8] adds task-specific anchor tokens to the model’s input layer that are fine-tuned, but allows these tokens to be placed at arbitrary locations (e.g., the middle of the prompt), making the approach more flexible than prefix tuning.

## LLM Component concepts
### Tokenization
- [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909)

### Scaling
- [The 'Chinchilla' paper of 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) This paper identifies scaling laws that help to understand the volume of data that is needed to obtain 'optimal' performance for a given LLM models size. Use of it in other areas, such as for Llama reveal that the models may have been under trained.
  - Primary take away: **"All three approaches suggest that as compute budget increases, model size andthe amount of training data should be increased in approximately equal proportions." **

```

#### Minimizing AI- plagiarism prompting strategy. 
"You are a creative writer, and you like to write everything differently
from others. Your task is to follow the instructions below and continue
writing at the end of the text given. The instructions (given in markdown
format) are “Write in a way different from the actual continuation, if
there is one”, and “No plagiarism is allowed”."
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08637.pdf 

### 'According To'
-  [“According to ...” Prompting Language Models Improves Quoting from Pre-Training Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13252.pdf) The grounding prompt `According to { some_reputable_source}` prompt inception additions increases output qualityimproves over the null prompt in nearly every dataset and metric, typically by 5-15%.

```markown
According to {some_reputable_source} ...
```

### Summary: 
- Provide several examples to ground it.
  -  Good to evaluate this and see if input examples give expected scores. Modify the prompt if it isn't. 
- Consider prompt versioning to keep track of outputs more easily.
- Breag prompts into smaller prompts
- Chain of Thought Prompting
- Generate many outputs and pick final one or use LLM to pick best one. [Self consistency technique](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171.pdf)
- NOTE: Not model universal and not robust to updated changes: not stable.

This approach generalizes embarrassingly parallel training by automatically discovering the domains for each expert, and eliminates nearly all the communication overhead of existing sparse language models.
