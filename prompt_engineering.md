## Prompting Principles
- **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
- **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

### Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`

## 'Escaping'

1. [This](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/gpt-4-tried-to-escape-into-the-internet-today-and-it-almost-worked-2689e549afb5)
   and [This](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-chatgpt-could-escape-to-the-internet-for-real-this-time-d29d27bf5b4a) have very simplistic examples of how GPT might try to escape. Far from functional and there are constraints on its output from Open AI. They imagined it as `thought experiment` in order to escape those confines. 
   
```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
JSON, HTML

```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think” 

#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
```python
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.
"""
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)
```

#### Ask for output in a specified format

#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

## Summarizing
### With a limit
```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site. 

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple 
backticks, in at most 30 words. 

## Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit
Review: ```{prod_review}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

### With a limit
```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site to give feedback to the \
Shipping deparmtment. 

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple 
backticks, in at most 30 words, and focusing on any aspects \
that mention shipping and delivery of the product. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```

```
### With a focus

```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site to give feedback to the \
pricing deparmtment, responsible for determining the \
price of the product.  

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple 
backticks, in at most 30 words, and focusing on any aspects \
that are relevant to the price and perceived value. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```

```
## Extract and summarize 
```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to extract relevant information from \ 
a product review from an ecommerce site to give \
feedback to the Shipping department. 

From the review below, delimited by triple quotes \
extract the information relevant to shipping and \ 
delivery. Limit to 30 words.
